Read the model input carefully:\nThe model input is a claim and evidence provided to verify the claim. The claim states that a music video was released on November 6, and the evidence includes sentences retrieved from web articles.\n2. Read the model response carefully:\nThe model response states that the claim is not supported because the evidence does not provide any information about the release date of the music video.\n3. Check whether the model response follows all instructions and requirements in the model input:\nThe model response does not follow the instructions in the model input because it does not provide any explanation for why the claim is not supported. The model input requires the model to provide reasoning for each part of the claim.\n4. Select your answer:\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.\n\nExplanation:\nThe model response does not provide any explanation for why the claim is not supported. The model input requires the model to provide reasoning for each part of the claim, but the model response only states that the claim is not supported without providing any explanation.

{"response": " Based on the instructions provided, I will carefully read the model input and response and check whether the model response follows all instructions and requirements in the model input.\n\nModel Input:\n\nThe claim is: Tyler, a former Democrat, was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs.\n\nThe evidence provided includes sentences retrieved from web articles, which are:\n\n* Line 34: Enraged Whig leaders denounced the President as a traitor and expelled him from the party two days later in a declaration published in newspapers throughout the nation.\n* Line 40: The Whigs demanded that he resign, to be succeeded by the Whig President Pro Tem of the Senate under existing succession law.\n* Line 44: The Whigs could not get their national bank, their high tariff, or their distribution bill to give the proceeds of the sale of public lands to the states for internal improvements.\n\nModel Response:\n\nThe model response is: The claim is supported.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe model response correctly states that the claim is supported by the evidence. However, there is an error in the response. The model response does not provide line numbers for the evidence supporting each part of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.\n\nLine numbers should be provided for each part of the claim to support the explanation that the claim is supported by the evidence. Without line numbers, it is difficult to verify that the model response accurately represents the evidence provided.\n\nCorrected Model Response:\n\nThe claim is supported.\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe claim that Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs is supported by the evidence.\n\nLine 34 states that Whig leaders denounced the President as a traitor and expelled him from the party two days later. Line 40 mentions that the Whigs demanded that Tyler resign, and line 44 indicates that the Whigs could not establish their national bank or their high tariff due to Tyler's actions.\n\nTherefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "finegrained_fact_verification_wice_test03718_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "finegrained_fact_verification", "task_source": "wice", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
