The model is also instructed to provide reasoning first, then state the answer at the end. If the question includes incorrect information or is invalid, the model should state that the question is unanswerable. If a future event is asked in the past tense, the question should also be classified as unanswerable.\n2. The model response states that the question does not provide enough information to determine which songwriter from Athens, Georgia had an album produced by Howard Bilerman. The model also states that it would require knowledge after May 3rd, 2008 to know if there was a songwriter with an album produced by Howard Bilerman between May 4th, 2008, and the present day. The model concludes that the question is unanswerable based on the given information.\n3. The model response follows all instructions and requirements in the model input.
