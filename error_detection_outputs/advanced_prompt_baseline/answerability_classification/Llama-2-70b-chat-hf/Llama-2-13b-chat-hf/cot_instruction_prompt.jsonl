The response also notes that even if we were able to correctly guess the person's identity based on the other details provided, we would still need additional information to confirm that they indeed presented the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid.\n3. Check whether the model response follows all instructions and requirements in the model input:\n\na. The model response does not provide an answer to the question. This is in line with the instructions in the model input, which state that the question is unanswerable.\n\nb. The model response provides a clear explanation for why the question is unanswerable, which is in line with the requirements in the model input.\n\nc. The model response does not include any factual errors or inconsistencies.\n\nd. The model response does not assume any future events have occurred that have not actually taken place (e.g., the presentation of the Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid).\n\nBased on the above analysis, I conclude that the model response contains no error. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nTherefore, the model response contains no error.", "prediction": "no_error", "label": "error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "answerability_classification_5ab9374b554299131ca422c6_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "answerability_classification", "task_source": "hotpotqa", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
{"response": " Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my analysis of the model response:\n\n1. Read the model input carefully:\nThe model input asks for the type of establishment Opry Mills is in Nashville, Tennessee, assuming the date is February 9, 2000.\n2. Read the model response carefully:\nThe model response provides reasoning that Opry Mills had not yet opened on February 9, 2000, and therefore it is impossible to determine what type of establishment it was at that time. The model response concludes that the question is unanswerable.\n3. Check whether the model response follows all instructions and requirements in the model input:\nThe model response does not follow the instruction to assume the date is February 9, 2000, as it provides reasoning that the establishment had not yet opened on that date. The model response also does not provide an answer to the question, which is a requirement of the model input.\n\nTherefore, I conclude that the model response contains an error. The model should have provided an answer to the question based on the assumption of the date given in the model input, even if it was a future event. The model response should have also followed the instructions and requirements provided in the model input.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "answerability_classification_5ab7f97a5542991d322237ef_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "answerability_classification", "task_source": "hotpotqa", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "easy"}}
