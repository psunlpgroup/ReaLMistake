The solution includes \"14/35 x 100\" as required, but the application of this calculation is incorrect based on the problem's actual requirements.\n\nThe correct approach should have involved calculating the number of patients remaining to be seen (35 total - 17 seen = 18 remaining), determining how many of those remaining have not been diagnosed with high blood pressure (since this was the actual question), and then calculating the percentage based on the remaining patients, not the total.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_199_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
