According to the problem statement, if the selling price is $25.00 and the profit is 20% of the selling price, the calculation provided does not accurately reflect this relationship. The correct approach would involve understanding that the $25.00 represents 120% of the cost price in a scenario where the profit is calculated on the cost price, but this contradicts the problem statement's indication that the profit is on the selling price.
