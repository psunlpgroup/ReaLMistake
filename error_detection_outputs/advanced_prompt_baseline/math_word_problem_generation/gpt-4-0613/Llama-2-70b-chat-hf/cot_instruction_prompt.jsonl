{"response": " The model response does not follow all instructions and requirements in the model input, therefore, the model response contains an error.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The model input specifically states that the generated question should start with \"A canteen requires 62 kgs of wheat for 6 days.\" However, the model response starts with \"A canteen requires 62 kgs of wheat for 6 days. If the canteen continues to use wheat at the same rate,\" which adds an extra clause that is not present in the model input.\n2. The model input requires the problem statement to include the quantity of wheat required for a certain number of days and the query for the quantity required for a different number of days. The model response only includes the query for the quantity required for a different number of days (15 days), but does not include the quantity of wheat required for the original 6 days.\n3. The model input requires the generated question to not include information that is not necessary to answer the question. However, the model response includes the phrase \"If the canteen continues to use wheat at the same rate,\" which is not necessary to answer the question and could potentially confuse the user.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_100_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "easy"}}
{"response": " The model response contains an error.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The model response does not follow the instruction to use integers in the solution. The solution includes the calculation of the highest common factor (HCF) using the Euclidean algorithm, which involves dividing integers by each other and finding the remainder. However, the final answer of 19 liters is not an integer.\n2. The model response does not follow the requirement to include only one solution without any unnecessary procedures. The solution includes multiple steps of dividing integers by each other and finding the remainder, which is not necessary to find the HCF.\n3. The model response does not follow the requirement to use reasonable data types and values for the domain of the question. The solution includes the calculation of the HCF of 551 and 437, which results in a non-integer value of 19. This is not a reasonable data type for the domain of liquid storage, where quantities are typically measured in integers.\n4. The model response does not follow the requirement to avoid approximations.

{"response": " The model response contains an error.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The model response does not follow the instruction to use reasonable data types and values for the domain of the question. The solution includes the phrase \"Let the salaries of A and B be 9x and 4x respectively,\" which implies that the salaries are expressed as integers. However, the problem statement mentions that the ratio of A's salary to B's salary is 9:4, which suggests that the salaries should be expressed as fractions.\n2. The model response includes an unnecessary step in the solution. The equation 1035x/100 + 4x = 5175 is solved by multiplying through by 100, which is not necessary. The equation can be solved directly by combining like terms: 1035x + 400x = 517500.\n3. The model response includes an approximation. The solution includes the step \"So, we can set up the equation: 9x \u00d7 115\u2044100 + 4x = 5175.\" This equation is not exact, as 115/100 is not a whole number. The exact equation would be 9x \u00d7 115 + 4x = 5175, which can be simplified to 1435x = 517500.\n4. The model response does not include the final answer to the generated question.
