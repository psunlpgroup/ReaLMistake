The evidence supports this claim. The \"bedroom tax\" is described as a policy that puts an added burden on disabled people (line 15), which indicates that it is an austerity measure that has attracted criticism. Furthermore, the evidence states that almost two-thirds of people affected by the loss of housing benefit on rooms deemed to be \"spare\" are disabled (line 23), which supports the claim that two thirds of council houses affected by the policy are occupied with a person with a disability.
