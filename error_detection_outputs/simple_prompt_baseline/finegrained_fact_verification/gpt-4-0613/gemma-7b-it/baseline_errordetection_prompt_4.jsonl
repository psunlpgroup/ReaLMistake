{"response": "## Evaluation\n\n**Model Input:**\n\nThe model input describes a scenario where a language model is provided with a claim and evidence, and the task is to evaluate the validity of the model response. The claim is that Tyler, a former Democrat, was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs. The evidence includes sentences retrieved from web articles that provide information about Tyler's presidency and the annexation of Texas.\n\n**Model Response:**\n\nThe model response accurately summarizes the information provided in the model input and concludes that the claim is supported by the evidence. It correctly identifies the relevant evidence sentences (lines 34, 40, and 44) that support the claim and explains how they contribute to the conclusion.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nThe model response is valid. It follows all instructions and requirements in the model input, including:\n\n* **Ending sentence:** \"Therefore, the claim is supported.\"\n* **Reasoning:** Provides line numbers of evidence sentences supporting each part of the claim.\n* **No external knowledge:** Does not use any knowledge beyond the provided evidence.\n* **Unnecessary information:** Does not include any information that is not necessary for verifying the claim.\n\nTherefore, the model response is valid.", "prediction": "no_error", "label": "no_error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "finegrained_fact_verification_wice_test03718_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "finegrained_fact_verification", "task_source": "wice", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
