{"response": "The model response accurately identifies that Mark Yudof was the University President and expressed positive sentiments about Monson's hiring, as indicated in lines 112-116. However, the model response claims that there is no mention of scandals related to Clem Haskins in the evidence, which is incorrect. The evidence does not directly mention \"scandals\" but the context of Clem Haskins' last game and the implication of needing to do things \"the right way\" (lines 87, 101, 104, 115-116) suggest a problematic past that Monson was expected to correct. This context could be interpreted as supporting the claim that Monson was hoped to help the program move past previous issues under Haskins.
