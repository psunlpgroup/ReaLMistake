{"response": " Thank you for providing the input and the model's response. Based on my evaluation, I conclude that the model response is not valid.\n\nThe claim consists of two parts: Tyler was expelled from the Whig Party after vetoing bills passed by the Whig congressional majority to reestablish a national bank and raise tariffs, and Tyler vetoed two bills calling for higher tariffs.\n\nThe evidence provided does not directly support the first part of the claim. While line 34 mentions that the Whig leaders denounced the President as a traitor and expelled him from the party, it does not specify the reason for the expulsion. Lines 36 and 41 suggest that the conflict between Tyler and the Whig Party was related to his refusal to sign certain bills, but they do not mention the specific bills or reasons for his vetoes. Line 44 notes that the Whigs could not pass their desired legislation despite Tyler's vetoes, which implies that there were multiple instances of disagreement between the President and the party. However, without further context, it remains unclear whether the vetoes that led to Tyler's expulsion were indeed related to the issues of a national bank and tariffs.\n\nRegarding the second part of the claim, line 40 confirms that Congress passed two bills calling for higher tariffs during Tyler's presidency, and line 41 reveals that he vetoed them both. This supports the assertion that Tyler vetoed bills aiming to increase tariffs. However, since the evidence does not conclusively link these vetoes to his expulsion from the Whig Party, the overall claim remains partially unsubstantiated.\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid because it does not provide a clear and direct support for the claim.
