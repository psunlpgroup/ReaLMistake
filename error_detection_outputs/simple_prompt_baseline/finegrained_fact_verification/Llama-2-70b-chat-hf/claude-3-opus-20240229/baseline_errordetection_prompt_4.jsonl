The FAA is conducting an additional review that may delay commercial air service at Paine Field (line 20).\n2. The new review is due to proposed flight operations bringing more passengers than originally approved in 2012 (line 22).\n3. The review timeline aligns with the claim, potentially taking place between November 2018 and a year later (line 24).\n4. The FAA has acknowledged the need for re-evaluation and will release preliminary analysis results for public review (lines 27-29).\n\nThe model response logically concludes that the evidence supports the claim based on these points.

{"response": "The model response does not fully address the claim and fails to provide a clear conclusion on whether the claim is supported or not by the evidence. The response analyzes the two parts of the claim separately but does not make a definitive statement about the claim as a whole.\n\nFor the first part of the claim, the model response acknowledges that the evidence suggests a conflict between Tyler and the Whig Party related to his vetoes, but it does not confirm that these vetoes were specifically related to bills on reestablishing a national bank and raising tariffs. The response correctly points out that the evidence is insufficient to fully support this part of the claim.\n\nRegarding the second part of the claim, the model response correctly identifies the evidence supporting Tyler's vetoes of bills calling for higher tariffs. However, it fails to connect these vetoes to his expulsion from the Whig Party, as mentioned in the claim.\n\nThe model input clearly states that the response should end with one of three specific sentences, depending on whether the claim is supported, not supported, or if it is unclear. The model response does not include any of these required sentences in its conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid.
