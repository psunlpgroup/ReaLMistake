Additionally, the solution does not include the exact phrase \"9x \u00d7 115\u2044100 = 5175\" as required.\n\nFurthermore, the response includes unnecessary information and procedures. For example, the solution calculates the monthly salary expense for the company before and after the raise, but this information is not requested in the problem statement. Also, the solution includes a verification of the final answer, which is not necessary and violates the requirement of not including any unnecessary procedures.\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_79_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
{"response": " The model response provided seems to be valid at first glance, as it addresses the requirements specified in the model input. However, upon closer inspection, there is an issue with the calculation of the commission.\n\nThe commission is calculated as 10% of the sales made by the servant, which is 5000 in this case. Therefore, the commission would be 5000 x 10% = 500.\n\nHowever, the model response states that the shopkeeper will have to pay the servant a total of 1500 (monthly salary) + 500 (commission) = 2000. This is incorrect, as the total amount the shopkeeper needs to pay should be 1500 (monthly salary) + 500 (commission) = 2500.\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid, as it contains a calculation error. The model should have caught this mistake and provided the correct total amount the shopkeeper needs to pay to the servant.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_301_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "easy"}}
