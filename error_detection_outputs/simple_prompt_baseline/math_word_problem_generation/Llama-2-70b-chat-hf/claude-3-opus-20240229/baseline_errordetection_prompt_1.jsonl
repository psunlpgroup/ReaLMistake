Instead, it only mentions this phrase at the end without properly integrating it into the solution.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_33_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
