The problem statement does not specify a minimum value for the third commission; it only requires an average of at least $350 over the three sales. The inequality X/3 >= 0 simply ensures that the commission is non-negative, not that it must be a specific amount like $1. Since there's no further information given to determine the exact value of X, the response assumes a minimum of $1, which is not justified by the provided requirements.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_5_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
