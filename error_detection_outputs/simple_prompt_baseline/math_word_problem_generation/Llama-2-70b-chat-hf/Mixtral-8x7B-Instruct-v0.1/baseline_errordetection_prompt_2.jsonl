The solution is also correctly derived and leads to the final answer without any unnecessary procedures or approximations.\n\nHowever, there is a discrepancy between the question and the solution. The question asks for the cost of 100 units of product B, while the solution provides the price of product B. Therefore, the solution should calculate the cost of 100 units of product B using the derived price of product B.\n\nThe corrected step-by-step solution should be:\n\nStep-by-Step Solution:\nLet's call the price of product A \"3x\" and the price of product B \"2x\". We know that the ratio of the price of product A to the price of product B is 3:2, so we can write an equation based on this:\n\n3x : 2x = 3:2\n\nWe also know that 200 units of product A cost $6000, so we can write another equation:\n\n3x \\* 200 = 6000\n\nNow, we need to solve for x. We can do this by substituting the second equation into the first equation:\n\n3(3x) : 2(2x) = 3:2\n9x : 4x = 3:2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n3x - 2x = 6000\n\nSolving for x, we get:\nx = 100\n\nSo, the price of product B is 2x = 200. Therefore, 100 units of product B will cost 200 \\* 100 = $20,000.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_207_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
