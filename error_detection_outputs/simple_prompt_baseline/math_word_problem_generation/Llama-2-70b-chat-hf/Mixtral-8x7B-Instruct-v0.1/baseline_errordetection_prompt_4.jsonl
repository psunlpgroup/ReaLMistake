{"response": "The model response includes a valid math word problem that requires an understanding of seating arrangements in a library reading room and uses only integers in the problem statement. The solution also uses integers and involves subtraction to find the number of unoccupied tables. However, there is an issue in the solution where the result of the division is incorrectly interpreted as a fraction of a table. Since the problem statement specifies that the solution should not include any approximation or unnecessary procedures, the division result should be rounded down to the nearest whole number, as there cannot be a fraction of a table. Therefore, the final answer should be 4 unoccupied tables, not 5.\n\nAdditionally, the solution includes unnecessary steps that are not required to solve the problem, such as calculating the number of empty seats before finding the number of unoccupied tables. The solution could have been simplified by directly calculating the number of unoccupied tables as follows:\n\nNumber of unoccupied tables = Total number of tables - (Number of students currently sitting / Number of students per table)\n= 30 - (12 / 4)\n= 30 - 3\n= 27\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid due to the incorrect interpretation of the division result and the inclusion of unnecessary steps in the solution.
