Bob took 210 minutes to complete the same task. Which is a longer period of time?\n\nSolution: To compare the two times, we need to convert both times to the same unit.

ABC Company pays an average of $18 per vehicle for parking. How much does ABC Company pay in total for parking every day?\n* Solution: First, let's calculate the total number of vehicles parked in each lot: Lot A: 30 vehicles x ($15 / vehicle) = 450, Lot B: 30 vehicles x ($20 / vehicle) = 600, Lot C: 30 vehicles x ($25 / vehicle) = 750. So, the total amount paid by ABC Company for parking every day is: Total Amount = 450 + 600 + 750 = 1800. Since ABC Company pays an average of $18 per vehicle, we can also calculate the total amount as follows: Total Amount = Number of Vehicles x Average Parking Fee = 30 vehicles x $18 = 540.
