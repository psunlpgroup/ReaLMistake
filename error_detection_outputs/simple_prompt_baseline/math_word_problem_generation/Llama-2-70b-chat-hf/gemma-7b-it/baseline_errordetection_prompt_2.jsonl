Currently, there are 18 bars remaining in a partially filled case. If the store wants to fill up the case to capacity, what percentage of a full case do they need to add?\n\nSolution:\nLet X represent the number of candy bars needed to fill up the case to capacity. Since the partial case has 18 bars, we can write:\n\nX + 18 = 30\n\nWe want to find out how many bars the store needs to add to make it a full case, so we subtract 18 from both sides:\n\nX = 30 - 18\n\nX = 12\n\nNow, we know that the store needs to add 12 bars to fill up the case. To find the percentage of a full case that this represents, we divide by 30 and multiply by 100:\n\n(12 / 30) x 100% = 40%\n\nTherefore, the store needs to add 40% of a full case to make it complete.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_22_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}

How many different ways can the hiring manager select the 4 candidates?\n\nSolution:\n\nLet's first identify the two groups:\n\nGroup 1: Present employees (5 applicants)\nGroup 2: Outside applicants (25 applicants)\n\nWe want to select 4 candidates, including exactly one from Group 1 and 3 from Group 2. We can do this by selecting 3 candidates from Group 2 and then choosing either 0 or 1 candidate from Group 1.\n\nSo, let's calculate the number of ways to select 3 candidates from Group 2:\n\nNumber of ways to select 3 candidates from Group 2 = C(25, 3) = 25! / (3! \\* 22!) = 1000\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of ways to select either 0 or 1 candidate from Group 1:\n\nNumber of ways to select 0 candidates from Group 1 = 1 (since there is only one way to select 0 candidates)\nNumber of ways to select 1 candidate from Group 1 = C(5, 1) = 5! / (1! \\* 4!) = 5\n\nTherefore, the total number of ways to select 4 candidates, including exactly one from Group 1, is:\n\nTotal number of ways = Number of ways to select 3 candidates from Group 2 \\* Number of ways to select 0 or 1 candidate from Group 1\n= 1000 \\* (1 + 5)\n= 1000 \\* 6\n= 6000\n\nHence, there are 6000 different ways the hiring manager can select 4 candidates, including exactly one of the applicants who is not a present employee of the company.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_234_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}

{"response": "## Explanation\n\nThe model response generally follows the instructions in the model input, but there is one error. The problem requires an understanding of salary and commission calculations, therefore the final answer must be unique. However, the model response includes the commission calculation formula for a different item value of 2000 instead of 5000.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_301_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "easy"}}
