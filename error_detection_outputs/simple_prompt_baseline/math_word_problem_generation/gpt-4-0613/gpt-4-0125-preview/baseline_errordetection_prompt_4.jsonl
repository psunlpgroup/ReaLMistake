The problem statement includes the area of an equilateral triangle and specifies it as \"4\u221a3 cm^2,\" meeting the specific requirements. The solution involves a square root operation and solving for an unknown variable (a: length of each side), as requested. The solution process uses integers and fractions, without including any other type of number, which aligns with the instructions to include [integers, fractions] and to avoid other types of numbers.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the simplification process in the solution. After multiplying both sides by 4 (Step 3) and dividing both sides by sqrt(3) (Step 4), the correct simplification in Step 5 should lead to \\(a^2 = 16\\), not \\(a^2 = 48\\). This error affects the final answer, as the correct final answer should be \\(a = \\sqrt{16} = 4\\), not \\(a = \\sqrt{48}\\). This mistake means the solution does not accurately follow the mathematical procedures required to solve the problem based on the given area of the equilateral triangle.\n\nDespite the response following the general structure and requirements (such as not including unnecessary information, approximations, or verification of the final answer), the incorrect mathematical operations and the resulting incorrect final answer mean the response does not fully comply with the requirement for the solution to be correct and based on reasonable data types and values for the domain of the question.\n\nTherefore, the model response is not valid.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_209_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
