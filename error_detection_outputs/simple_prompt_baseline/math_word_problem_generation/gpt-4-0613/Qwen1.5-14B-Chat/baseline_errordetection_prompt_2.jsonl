{"response": "Explanation: The model response appears to have correctly addressed the given requirements.

Since the requirement states that integers with units should be used instead of fractions when not specified, this might be considered an error.

The correct format for this calculation would be to express the 10% as a fraction (10/100) and multiply it by $36.40, resulting in a fraction or a number with one decimal place.
