How much is John's investment worth now?\n\nSolution:\nStep 1: First, we need to find out how many shares John bought. We can do this by dividing the total amount he invested by the price of each share when he bought it. \nSo, the number of shares (x) = Total investment / Price of each share when bought\nx = $10,000 / $25.75 = 388 shares\n\nStep 2: Now, we need to find out how much John's investment is worth now. We can do this by multiplying the number of whole shares he has by the current price of each share.\nSo, the current worth of investment = Number of whole shares * Current price of each share\n= 388 shares * $30.50 = $11,744\n\nSo, John's investment is worth $11,744 now.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_40_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}

However, the model incorrectly applies the formula by using 6 as the value of n (the total number of trials) and 4 as the value of k (the number of successful outcomes wanted).\n\nThe correct values for n and k should be 6 and 5, respectively. The total number of outcomes when a coin is tossed 6 times is 2^6 = 64, as correctly stated in Step 1. However, the number of ways to get exactly 4 heads in 6 tosses is C(6, 5) = 6! / [5!(6-5)!] = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / [(5*4*3*2*1)*(1)] = 5.\n\nTherefore, the correct solution is:\n\nStep 1: Identify the total number of outcomes when a coin is tossed 6 times. Since a coin has 2 outcomes (heads or tails), the total number of outcomes is 2^6 = 64.\n\nStep 2: Identify the number of ways to get exactly 4 heads in 6 tosses. This is a combination problem, which can be solved using the combination formula C(n, k) = n! / [k!(n-k)!], where n is the total number of trials (6 in this case), k is the number of successful outcomes we want (5 in this case), and \"!\" denotes factorial. \n\nSo, the number of ways to get 4 heads in 6 tosses is C(6, 5) = 6! / [5!(6-5)!] = (6*5*4*3*2*1) / [(5*4*3*2*1)*(1)] = 5.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the probability of getting exactly 4 heads in 6 tosses. This is the number of ways to get 4 heads divided by the total number of outcomes. \n\nSo, the probability is 5 / 64.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error, and the correct solution is 5/64.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_93_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
