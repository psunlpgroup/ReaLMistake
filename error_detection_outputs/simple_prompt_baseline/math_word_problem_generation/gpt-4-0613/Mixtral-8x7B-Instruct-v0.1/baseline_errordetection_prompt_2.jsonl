According to the problem, the total cost of the cricket equipment is 210 dollars, and the cost of each item should be in integers. However, the model response provides non-integer values for the cost of each cricket bat and each cricket ball.\n\nThe error occurred due to the incorrect calculation of the cost per unit of ratio in Step 3. The model response divided the total cost (210 dollars) by the total ratio (4) to get the cost per unit of ratio (52.5 dollars). However, this calculation should have been done by dividing the total cost (210 dollars) by the sum of the parts of the ratio (3+1=4), which is 3 (for bats) + 1 (for balls) = 4. Therefore, the correct cost per unit of ratio should be 210 dollars / 4 = 52.50 dollars.\n\nUsing this correct cost per unit of ratio, the cost of each cricket bat should be 3 (from the ratio) * 52.50 dollars = 157.50 dollars, and the cost of each cricket ball should be 1 (from the ratio) * 52.50 dollars = 52.50 dollars. Since the problem states that the club bought 3 cricket bats, the total cost for the bats should be 3 * 157.50 dollars = 472.50 dollars. Similarly, since the club bought 2 cricket balls, the total cost for the balls should be 2 * 52.50 dollars = 105 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be that each cricket bat costs 157.50 dollars and each cricket ball costs 52.50 dollars.\n\nConclusion:\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "math_problem_generation_81_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "math_problem_generation", "task_source": "aqua", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
