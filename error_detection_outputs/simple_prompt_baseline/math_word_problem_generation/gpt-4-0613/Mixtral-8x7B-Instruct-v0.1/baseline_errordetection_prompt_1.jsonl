However, the solution states that each cricket bat costs 157.5 dollars and each cricket ball costs 52.5 dollars, which does not satisfy the given ratio and the total cost.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we can first find the cost per unit of ratio by dividing the total cost by the sum of the ratio, which is 4 (3 for cricket bats and 1 for cricket balls). So, the cost per unit of ratio is 210 dollars \u00f7 4 = 52.5 dollars. Then, we can find the cost of each cricket bat by multiplying the cost per unit of ratio by the ratio of cricket bats, which is 3, so the cost of each cricket bat is 3 * 52.5 dollars = 157.5 dollars. Similarly, we can find the cost of each cricket ball by multiplying the cost per unit of ratio by the ratio of cricket balls, which is 1, so the cost of each cricket ball is 1 * 52.5 dollars = 52.5 dollars. However, since we are buying 3 cricket bats and 2 cricket balls, the total cost for the bats should be 3 * 157.5 dollars = 472.5 dollars, and the total cost for the balls should be 2 * 52.5 dollars = 105 dollars.
