However, the question explicitly states that the artist departed from 2PM prior to the release of their DVD \"Take Off,\" which was released on November 29, 2011, which is before December 17, 2011. Therefore, the question does not require knowledge of future events, and the model should have answered it based on the information available up until November 29, 2011.\n\nFurthermore, the model's statement that there have been no reported cases of any member leaving 2PM before the release of their DVD \"Take Off\" is incorrect.
