The reasoning provided correctly states that Opry Mills had not opened on February 9, 2000, which makes the question unanswerable based on the given date assumption. However, the instruction to state that the question is \"unanswerable\" at the end of the response is missing. A corrected version would be:\n\nReasoning:\n\nOpry Mills is a shopping mall located in Nashville, Tennessee. It opened on May 18, 2000, which is after the date of February 9, 2000. Therefore, on February 9, 2000, the establishment's type could not be determined.\n\nAnswer: Unanswerable due to the date constraint provided in the question.", "prediction": "error", "label": "no_error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "answerability_classification_5ab7f97a5542991d322237ef_meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "task_name": "answerability_classification", "task_source": "hotpotqa", "llm_response_model": "meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "easy"}}
