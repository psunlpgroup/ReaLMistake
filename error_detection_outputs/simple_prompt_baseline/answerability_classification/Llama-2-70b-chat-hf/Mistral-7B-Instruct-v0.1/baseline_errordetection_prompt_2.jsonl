Firstly, Bridget Cromwell did not have a father who was a prominent military and political leader or Lord Protector. Oliver Cromwell, who held those positions, did not have a daughter named Bridget. Secondly, Oliver Cromwell played no role in the American Civil War, as he died in 1658, nearly a century before the American Civil War began in 1861. Lastly, even if we were to assume that the question refers to another person with the name Bridget Cromwell, there is no record of such a person being associated with the American Civil War or having a father who was a prominent military and political leader.
