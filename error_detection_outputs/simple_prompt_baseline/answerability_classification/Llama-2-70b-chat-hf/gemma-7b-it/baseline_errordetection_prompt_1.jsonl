However, the question is problematic because it asks about a future event (the conviction of a president) in the past tense. This makes the question unclear and difficult to answer definitively. Additionally, the reference to \"his brother\" being a high-ranking member suggests that the question may be referring to a specific individual, but does not provide enough context to determine who that might be.\n\nTherefore, I would argue that the question is unanswerable based on the ambiguity and inconsistency in its wording.
