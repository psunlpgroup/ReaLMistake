Firstly, there is no evidence of a person named Bridget Cromwell who had an English military and political leader as her father, nor is there any record of this father becoming the Lord Protector. Secondly, the question incorrectly associates this supposed father figure with the American Civil War, which is impossible since he died in 1658, nearly a century before the war began.
