Furthermore, the question is answerable based on the information available up to that date, and the model's response does not violate any of the specified requirements, such as avoiding future events asked in the past tense or dealing with incorrect information.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains no error.", "prediction": "no_error", "label": "error", "correct": false, "metadata": {"id": "answerability_classification_5ab624b855429953192ad26d_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "answerability_classification", "task_source": "hotpotqa", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}
{"response": "The model response correctly identifies that the question does not provide enough information to determine the architectural style of the building appraised by Robert Von Ancken. It accurately points out that the architectural style is typically associated with the architect or the era of construction, not the appraiser.

{"response": "The model response correctly identifies Fredric March as the actor who starred in \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" in 1946 and \"The Crowded Sky\" in 1960. However, it incorrectly states that the question contains incorrect information about the actor's birthplace, claiming that Fredric March was born in Racine, Wisconsin, and not in Alabama, as the question suggests. The question does not specify Fredric March by name, so the model's task was to identify any actor fitting the criteria, not to validate Fredric March's birthplace. The error lies in the model's unnecessary correction of the question's premise regarding the actor's birthplace, which was not required by the task. The task was to answer the question based on the information provided, assuming it to be correct, or to classify the question as unanswerable if it pertained to future events or contained inconsistencies. The birthplace of the actor does not fall into these categories.\n\nTherefore, the model response contains an error.", "prediction": "error", "label": "error", "correct": true, "metadata": {"id": "answerability_classification_5add870b5542995b365fab3c_gpt-4-0613", "task_name": "answerability_classification", "task_source": "hotpotqa", "llm_response_model": "gpt-4-0613", "dataset": "realmistake", "difficulty": "difficult"}}

{"response": "The model response correctly follows the instructions given in the model input.

It then correctly identifies that, given the current date of July 22, 2016, in the scenario, this information would not be known or available, thus classifying the question as unanswerable.
